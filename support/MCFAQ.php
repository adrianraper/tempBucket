             <h2><a name="FAQ16">Can teachers print the exercises?</a> 
     	  <p>Robert, 4 June 2010</p></h2>
      
<p>Yes, once you purchase the program teachers can print the exercises. The
exercises can be used in the classroom or as homework or extra review.</p>

       <h2><a name="FAQ15">Can teachers print the maps from the Geography section.</a> 
     	  <p>Emily, 2 June 2010</p></h2>
      
<p>Yes, once you purchase the program you can print the maps. Simply right
click on the map, then go to print and left click.</p>

     <h2><a name="FAQ14">How can I use the dictionary?</a> 
     	  <p>Joe, 1 June 2010</p></h2>
      
<p>To look up any word in the online dictionary, hold down the Control (CTRL)
key while you click on the word.</p>
     	<p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
     
     <h2><a name="FAQ13">Is My Canada SmartBoard compatible?</a> 
     	  <p>Alfred, 31 May 2010</p></h2>
      
<p>Yes, the program is SmartBoard friendly. Many features available with the
SmartBoard, lend themselves very well to using My Canada in a teacher
centred setting. </p>

     	<h2><a name="FAQ12">I removed the checkmarks beside the exercise titles in Results Manager to disable exercises for selected students, but I found they are enabled again afterwards when I log in as administrator to change students' profiles. What did I do?</a> 
     	  <p>Aldo, 28 May 2010</p></h2>
       
        <p>In Results Manager, the function to disable exercises for students is called &quot;hidden content".
Hidden Content is group-specific. When teachers log into Results Manager, they only see their own group(s) of students and change the content the students can access. So two different teachers can set up profiles of content that are very different for their students without any clash.
Administrators can see all groups in their institution.</p>
<p>My guess is that Aldo clicked on two different  groups when he logged in as a teacher and later as an administrator. If you click on a student (or indeed a teacher) on the right of the screen, rather than a group, the checkmarks all disappear because you can't set hidden content for a single student, only for a whole group.</p>

         <h2><a name="FAQ11">Do you support LDAP for student login?</a>     <p>Mike Hulme, Aksum, 25 May 2010</p></h2>
    
         <p>I am afraid that we don't. However you can import student details to Results Manager from a spreadsheet if you can export that from your student management system. You can also control whether students use their name or ID to log in.</p>

             <p>Elizabeth Anne, 18 May 2010</p></h2>
      
        <p>Install Results Manager and My Canada to the server, then you have a common database so that Results Manager can pick up the progress for all your students in one place, and it won't matter which computer students work on.</p>

        <p>Some browsers block pop-ups without any warning - and we use pop-ups from www.ClarityEnglish.com to run My Canada.

        <h2><a name="FAQ8">How do I run your programs with SCORM?</a>
           <p>Simon Mellor-Clark, 6 May 2010</p>
        </h2>
     

        <p>You have to have a learner-tracking licence to integrate with SCORM since the learner details are passed to the Clarity program (so it is not anonymous) and then the Clarity program sends progress data back to Moodle's built-in reports (so it is tracking). SCORM handles all login, so if a student has a Moodle account and is enrolled in a course that contains a unit from a Clarity program, they will automatically be able to run that unit. If it is their first time to do so, the Clarity program will add their details to the database and check off one licence. The same details will be picked up when the same  student runs that program (from<strong> </strong>any  Moodle course).</p>
<p>The first step is just to check that you are satisfied with the Moodle integration, so if you visit <a href="http://www.clarityenglish.com/support/tech/tech04_integration/tech0402.php" target="_blank">here</a> and download one of the learning objects. You should then be able to import this as a SCORM object into a Moodle course. The actual software and content are all hosted on Clarity servers, with  pointers going into your system. This keeps everything very small and tidy.</p>

        <h2><a name="FAQ6">Can I set up a link to My Canada on my library’s website and allow subscribers to start the program from there without having to log in?</a>
        
            <p>Lucas Scully, University Library, 12 April 2010</p>
        </h2>
    
        <p>Yes. We can work with your EZproxy system. You just need to tell us the IP address that your EZproxy system uses and we will use this to limit access to the software. Then you can put an image and link on your website and only subscribers who have logged in to your system will be able to use the program.</p>
       
        <p class="top"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        
         <h2><a name="FAQ5">We would like to link directly to a particular unit in My Canada. How do we do that?</a>
                  <p>Lingnan, 2 April 2010</p>
         </h2>

        <p>You can look at this item in our integration page that gives you full details on how to do this. It will show you how to build a URL link that goes directly to the unit you want. Click <a href="http://www.clarityenglish.com/support/tech/pdf/DirectAccess.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.</p>

         <h2><a name="FAQ3">Are the programs audio only or video, on CD's or DVD's or in some other form?</a>
           <p>Betty-Lu Holland, 17 March 2010</p>
         </h2>

        <p>The programs come in CD format for network installation, or are available as subscriptions for online use. While they are mostly used for independent learning, we know that many schools also use the programs for classroom work, homework and testing. You get full advantage from ICT resources when you are able to use it in a 'blended' fashion so that the students can get the best out of the native speaker audio, video, grammar, reading, feedback, etc.</p>

        <h2><a name="FAQ2">Is it possible to let students use My Canada first before I assign them into different groups?</a>
                 <p>Jonathan Pratt, 10 March 2010</p>
        </h2>

        <p>Yes, this is absolutely fine. You can let them self-register - or input their names yourself - and then let them loose on the program. When you have time, you can set up groups and assign students to them.</p>

 <h2><a name="FAQ1">I can’t run My Canada on my Internet browser.</a>
          <p>Karen Tham, 22 February 2010</p>
 </h2>
 
        <p>You can run My Canada on pretty much any web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc). The browser must have Adobe Flash player 9 or higher installed. If you don't have this, then the front screen of My Canada would show  a link to download and install Flash.</p>
