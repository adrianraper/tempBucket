			<p><b>Blackbeard's Treasure.</b></p>
			
			<p>When we hear of pirates these days, we think of people who copy DVDs or steal <g id="target1">song</g> from the Internet. 
			This may be bad, but at least nobody dies.</p>

			<p>It was different 300 years ago.  The most famous pirate of them all was Blackbeard.  From 1716 to 1718, he and
			his men attacked ships in the Atlantic and the Caribbean.  They killed the crews and the <g id="target2">pasengers</g>
			and stole gold, silver, jewels - and even sugar, cocoa and cotton, which were being taken to Europe.</p>

			<p>Backbeard was quite young - under 30 years old - and he had long black <g id="target3">hairs</g> and a bushy black
			beard.  He put burning rope into his hair to make himself look even more frightening.  He was captain of his ship
			and a hero <g id="target4">with</g> other pirates.</p>

			<p>This is how he was caught.  In 1718 he went to his favourite hiding place on Ocracoke Island off North Carolina.
			He decided to have a party with all the other pirates.  They <g id="target5">dance</g>, drank and lit a huge fire.</p>

			<p>Somebody saw the light from the fire and <g id="target6">tells</g> the navy.  The navy sent two ships to catch the
			pirates, and at dawn they attacked.  Blackbeard sank one of the ships, and ran his ship up against the other.</p>
