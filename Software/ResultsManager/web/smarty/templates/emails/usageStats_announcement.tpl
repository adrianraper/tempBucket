On the first of each month you will receive an email which includes a link. Clicking on the link will send you to Clarity's Results Manager. You then click on each of your programs to generate a detailed one-page report which you can view online, or download as a pdf, and print. You can revisit the link at any time in the next month.

There is no charge associated with this service, our goal is to help you get the most benefit - and full value - from the titles you have purchased. We hope you can use this tool to tell whether any activities you do to try and increase student learning are working.	</td>
