			Why am I not appearing on the right?  Apparently its because I need to put display:inline on the body, not the divs themselves.  There is
			certainly a good reason for this but I am fucked if I know what it is. <b>BUT</b> it turns out that the browser is doing exactly the same
			thing!  This is great news.
