			<p>'Hello, Sufiya?' It was Shama Shakil on the phone.</p>
			
			<p>'Shama, how are you, what's up?'</p>
			
			<p>'Have you heard about Myna Hyder?' asked Shama.  'Her husband has left her!  He just walked out of the house on Saturday afternoon.
			<g id="target1">He said that he had never loved her and that he was going to make a new life for himself!</g>'</p>
			
			<p>'How awful!  How is poor Myna?'</p>
			
			<p>'Well,' said Shama, 'Naturally, she's very upset.  <g id="target2">She said she had simply not suspected anything was wrong.  Then 
			suddenly he was off down the steps with his suitcase shouting "That's it!  I'm leaving!  I told you to stop feeding me
			that banana and garlic curry!"</g></p>
			
			<p>'What?' exclaimed Sufiya.  'He said he was leaving her because of her curry?'</p>
			
			<p>'Incredible, isn't it?' said Shama with satisfaction.  'And Myna was always talking about how much Raz loved her cooking'</p>
			
			<p>Sufiya wondered if there was anything they could do for Myna.  She also wondered about how Myna would manage without her husband.</p>
