You will be pleased to hear that our Study Skills Success package has been given a major upgrade. Highlights include sections on Critical Thinking and Presentations, introductory videos and student tips.<br/>
For full details, please see <a href="http://www.ClarityEnglish.com/program/studyskills.php" target="_blank">www.ClarityEnglish.com/StudySkillsSuccess</a>.

  <tr align="left" valign="top">
    <td height="28" >
As you currently subscribe to Study Skills Success, you can switch to the new version immediately. But since this might not be a convenient time, we can also offer you a delayed switch on request.

<b>What happens if you switch now?</b><br>
If your students login through www.ClarityEnglish.com they will see a new icon for Study Skills Success and will simply go into the new version. Their name and password don't change. Progress records from the old version will NOT be shown to students from within the new version. But Results Manager will show you both versions and you can see all progress records for both.<br/><br/>
The interface is different and the menus are different, so any guides or lessons planned around the old version might need to be adapted.<br/><br/>
If you use a direct URL to link to Study Skills Success, this will change. When the switch is made, we will send an email confirming all the details.

    <td height="28" >
<b>When can I delay switching to?</b><br>
We will offer both versions until 1st August 2011, at which point we will switch everyone. (If you have a very strong need to go past this date, do let us know.)

  <tr align="left" valign="top">
    <td height="28" >
<b>What do I have to do now?</b><br>
If you would like to keep the old version until 1st August just send a reply to this email. If we don't hear from you we will assume that you want to switch to the new version and we will do it on May 11th 2011.

    <td height="28" >
If you have any questions about this, either now or after the switch, please do let me know.
I hope that you and your students enjoy the brand new Study Skills Success V9!
