       <p>This course aims to help international students adapt to life on a UK campus.
The materials in this part of the programme are designed to be used by a teacher with learners in a face-to-face class. In each unit, there are approximately two hours of material, though many teachers will want to select and supplement the content.</p>
<p>Each unit centres upon a series of short streaming videos. It is necessary for the teacher to be able to project these onto a screen in class, e.g. using an interactive whiteboard.</p>
<p>Learners' task sheets can be printed and duplicated to class members. Although Access UK retains copyright of all materials, we give permission to licence holders to make photocopies*. There are also teachers’ notes, which often include role play cards that will also need to be copied.</p>
<p>The audio clips on the Teachers’ Site provide models of key items of language from each unit.</p>
<p>Access UK provides a set of online interactive exercises for learners working independently. These can also be used to consolidate and extend work done in class. The teacher may want to introduce learners to these exercises in a computer lab. However, once learners have a password, they can access this area of the programme from any computer with Internet access.</p>
<p><i>*up to the number of the licences they hold</i></p>
