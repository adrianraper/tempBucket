  <p>Success in the spoken test depends on simple clear statements, extended where appropriate with suitable examples or remarks. When you talk about yourself, give an example to illustrate your point. The Examiner knows nothing about you. Your words will give him or her a clearer picture of you and your interests. Phases 1 and 2 consist of questions asked by the examiner. Answer them fully, logically and clearly, if you can. If you can't, communicate fully, logically and clearly.</p>
