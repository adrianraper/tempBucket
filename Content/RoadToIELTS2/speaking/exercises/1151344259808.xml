		<li>Have I given you enough information?"</li>
		<li>"Shall I tell you more about it?"</li>
		<li>"That's about all I know."</li>
		<li>"Would you like me to explain anything?"</li>
		<li>"Do you need to know anything else?"</li>
	</ul></li>
    <li>Smile, say, "Thank you. Goodbye", and leave the room.</li>
    <li>Enjoy the experience!</li>
  </ol>
  <h6><p>Now you are ready for your speaking test.</p></h6>
  
  <ol>
  	<li>Use the unique experiences of your own life to enhance 	your performance.</li>
    <li>Use your language skills simply and clearly.</li>
    <li>Use your communication skills effectively.</li>
