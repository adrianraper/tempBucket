<p>Watch Zafir again, how many points does he make?</p>

<p class="linespace"></p>
<p>What advice would you give him about making his points more clearly?</p>

<p class="linespace"></p>
<p>Look at the list below:</p>

<ol>
	<li>State each point clearly</li>
	<li>Give an example to illustrate each point</li>
	<li>Use linking words and phrases, such as "also", or "as well as"</li>
	<li>Use a wider vocabulary &#x2013; perhaps talk about the internet, for example</li>
	<li>Make more points</li>
	<li>Avoid too much repetition</li>
</ol>

<p class="linespace"></p>
<p>Can you think of at least three ways in which daily life has changed since the arrival of modern technology? Don't forget to give an example for each one!</p>
