  <h1>Assessment</h1>
    
	<p>In the speaking test, you are assessed on the following skills:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>General fluency and coherence - that is, the logical	sequence of sentences, the clear marking of stages in	a discussion, and the use of connectors - study these;</li>
    <li>Giving information about yourself;</li>
    <li>Speculating on future developments;</li>
    <li>Giving opinions supported by reasons;</li>
    <li>Pronunciation;</li>
    <li>The ability to talk about general topics in a natural way;</li>
    <li>Comparing ideas or situations;</li>
    <li>Using the right vocabulary to deal with your conversation	- such as the range and appropriateness of your	vocabulary, and your ability to use other words to cover	gaps;</li>
    <li>Using grammar adequately for communication - for	example, the length and complexity of your spoken	sentences, the range of clauses, and their effect on	communication (rather than absence of errors). Learn	strategies to cover your gaps;</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h6><p>How can I prepare for the test?</p></h6>
  
  <ol>
  	<li><b>Specific Preparation</b><br/>
  The only one of the above skills which you can prepare	specifically is 2. (Giving information about yourself.)</li>
  
  	<li><b>Learn General Language Skills</b><br/>
  Learning expressions to deal with speculation, 	comparisons, giving opinions, will help enormously.</li>
  
  	<li><b>Learn Communication Skills</b><br/>
  How to present yourself.	Techniques to cover gaps in your knowledge.	How to put your ideas in order.	Suitable ways to end your contribution to the	conversation.</li>
