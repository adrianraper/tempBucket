<ol>
	<li>Arrange the main events of your life in order and find suitable linking phrases.</li>
	
	<li>Think of questions the examiner might ask you about your schooldays / university life / work experience, and answer them.</li>
	
	<li>Look at the answers below and you will see how each of them has been extended:</li>
	
	<p class="dialogue">Q:<tab/>Where did you go to school?</p>

	<p class="dialogue">A:<tab/>I went to school near my home and I liked that	because it meant my friends all lived in the same	neighbourhood.</p>

	<p class="dialogue">Q:<tab/>What do you want to study at university?</p>

	<p class="dialogue">A:<tab/>I want to study civil engineering because we	had a serious earthquake in my area and I became 	interested in the reinforcement of buildings.</p>

	<p class="dialogue">Q:<tab/>How do you travel to work?</p>

	<p class="dialogue">A:<tab/>I go to work by bus which is time-consuming and	tiring, because buses are not regular and are often	overcrowded.</p>

	<li>Think of ways you can extend the answers to questions by adding other bits of interesting information.</li>
