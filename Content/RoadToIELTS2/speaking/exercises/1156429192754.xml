  <p><b>Question Card</b></p>
  <p>Describe an advertisement you have seen, on TV or elsewhere, that made an impression on you.</p>
  <p class="linespace"></p>
  <p>You should say:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>what it showed</li>
	<li>who it was aimed at</li>
	<li>what effect it had on you</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="linespace"></p>
  <p>And explain why you find this type of advertising admirable or not.</p>
  <p class="linespace"></p>
  <p><b>The follow-up question</b></p>
  
  <p>At the end of Part 2, the Examiner often asks a question. The next clip shows the end of each candidate's talk about an advertisement. Look at the different ways they answer the question.</p>
  <p class="linespace"></p>
  <p>Zafir should have expanded in one or two short sentences.</p>
  <p class="linespace"></p>
  <p>Dmitris performs much better. Always remember to give reasons for your answers, rather then just agreeing or disagreeing with the statement the examiner makes.</p>
