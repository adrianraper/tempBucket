	<p>You and Dimitris will now answer some more questions. Answer them yourself first, and then look at what Dimitris said.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>How do you think daily life was before the arrival of modern technology?</li>
		
		<li>In the future, how is technology going to affect our lives?</li>
		
		<li>What is the value of scientific research?</li>
	
		<li>Is it worth the huge amount of money that is spent on it?</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p class="linespace"></p>
	<p>You and Dimitris have both probably answered some questions better than others. In one case, Dimitris could have given more examples. He sometimes has problems with vocabulary and grammar, and is maybe a little unclear at times. Think about your own weak areas in this task and what you can do to improve them.</p>
