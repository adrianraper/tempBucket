  <p class="feedbacktext">1. Mark says 'Cornish .... has been extinct since the nineteenth century' and 'extinct' means the same as 'disappeared'.</p>

<section id="fb2">
  <p class="feedbacktext">2. Mark says Manx 'died out in the 1940s' and 'died out' means the same as disappeared.</p>

<section id="fb3">
  <p class="feedbacktext">3. The speaker says 'about one person in five' which means the same as 'a fifth'.</p>

<section id="fb5">
  <p class="feedbacktext">5. The speaker says that some Western explorers brought a flu virus to the Trumai people and that there were only 10 people who survived and so their language disappeared.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb6">
  <p class="feedbacktext">6. The speaker says that Catalan is 'actually spoken by more people today than in the 1970s' so therefore it is more widely spoken now.</p>

<p class="popuptext">You should be able to tell from the question asked and the headings in the tables and the content of the tables that you are going to hear people talking about endangered languages.</p>
<p class="popuptext1"><b>Questions 1-6</b></p>
<p class="popuptext2">From your general knowledge you might be able to guess one or two of the answers. However, the most useful thing you can do there is to make yourself familiar with the statements. You should be able to put them into two categories; 'a language that has disappeared' and 'a language that is still spoken' with one statement left that doesn't fit either.</p>
