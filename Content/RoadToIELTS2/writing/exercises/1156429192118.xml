<p class="popuptext"><b>Writing Task 2</b></p>
<p class="popuptext"> You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.</p>
<p class="popuptext"> Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic.</p>
<p class="popuptext"><b> Many television news programmes show pictures of events in the news which people find upsetting. While television has a duty to report important news, it should not bring disturbing images into people's homes.</b></p>
<p class="popuptext"><b> To what extent do you agree or disagree?</b></p>

<p class="popuptext">You should write at least 250 words</p>
<p class="popuptext">You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.</p>

<section id="examtips">
<p class="popuptext">The plan you saw in the previous exercise is just one way to organize a 'for and against' composition. Another way is to form paragraphs by pairing arguments and counter-arguments. If you are going to use the composition structure shown in this exercise, the easiest way to do this is to state the argument you don't agree with first, and then state a counter-argument, which refutes it. In order to be able to write at least 250 words, you will need three or four arguments and the same number of counter-arguments.</p>

<p class="popuptext">This is a good structure to use if you find you have thought of a lot of arguments for and against. You will not have the time or space to include them all, and by using this composition structure, you will find it easier to decide which arguments to keep and which to reject. But remember, this structure only works when you have a counter-argument to match each argument.</p>
