  <p align="left">Dear Pat,</p>
  <p align="left">My English teacher has told me you're looking for a penfriend so I'm writing to introduce myself to you.</p>
  <p align="left">
    <font color="#000000">I'm 24 years old and I live in Hong Kong. I work in the tourist industry as a tour guide. I live with my parents on an outlying island and I travel to work by ferry <g id="t1">every day</g>. I love my job as I get to meet so many interesting people from all over the world, but I don't like having to work on public holidays and at the weekend!</font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <font color="#000000">As for my hobbies and interests, I'm a bit of a fitness fanatic! I go jogging <g id="t2">every morning</g> before I go to work and I <g id="t3">always</g> do some yoga before I go to bed. I play badminton <g id="t4">twice a week</g> and squash about <g id="t5">once a fortnight</g>. I enjoy hiking and try and get out to the country park at least <g id="t6">once a month</g>, but I prefer going swimming in the summer because I can't stand the heat. And I absolutely detest gyms! I hate running on a treadmill that doesn't go anywhere and staring aimlessly into space. Apart from sport, I also like dancing and I <g id="t7">often</g> go clubbing with friends at the weekend. I'm really keen on disco music and I can dance for hours.</font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <font color="#000000">Anyway, enough about me! What about you? What do you like doing in your free time? I hope you'll write soon and tell me about yourself.</font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
  <p align="left">Best wishes,</p>
  <p align="left">Kim</p>

    <font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">There are also several ways to express the frequency with which we do things. To avoid repetition, you should try to use a mixture of frequency adverbs such as 'always' and 'usually', and adverbial phrases such as 'once or twice a week' and 'every day'.</font>
