  <p>Dear Pat,</p>
  <p>My English teacher has told me you're looking for a penfriend so I'm writing to introduce myself to you.</p>
  <p>I'm 24 years old and I live in Hong Kong. I work in the tourist industry as a tour guide. I live with my parents on an outlying island and I travel to work by ferry&#xA0;<g id="t1">every day</g>. I love my job as I get to meet so many interesting people from all over the world, but I don't like having to work on public holidays and at the weekend!</p>
  <p>As for my hobbies and interests, I'm a bit of a fitness fanatic! I go jogging&#xA0;<g id="t2">every morning</g>&#xA0;before I go to work and I&#xA0;<g id="t3">always</g>&#xA0;do some yoga before I go to bed. I play badminton&#xA0;<g id="t4">twice a week</g>&#xA0;and squash about&#xA0;<g id="t5">once a fortnight</g>. I enjoy hiking and try and get out to the country park at least&#xA0;<g id="t6">once a month</g>, but I prefer going swimming in the summer because I can't stand the heat. And I absolutely detest gyms! I hate running on a treadmill that doesn't go anywhere and staring aimlessly into space. Apart from sport, I also like dancing and I&#xA0;<g id="t7">often</g>&#xA0;go clubbing with friends at the weekend. I'm really keen on disco music and I can dance for hours.</p>
  <p>Anyway, enough about me! What about you? What do you like doing in your free time? I hope you'll write soon and tell me about yourself.</p>
  <p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
  <p>Best wishes,</p>
  <p>Kim</p>

  <p class="popuptext">There are also several ways to express the frequency with which we do things. To avoid repetition, you should try to use a mixture of frequency adverbs such as 'always' and 'usually', and adverbial phrases such as 'once or twice a week' and 'every day'.</p>
