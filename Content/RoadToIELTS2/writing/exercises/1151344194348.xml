  <p align="left">The bar chart compares the size of the active membership of different religious faiths in the UK and shows <g id="t1">increases</g> in membership numbers between 1970 and 2000. The pie chart gives an indication of how often adults in Britain participated in religious services <g id="t2">at</g> 1999.</p>
  <p align="left">A first glance at the bar chart shows that the Christian faith <g id="t3">has had</g> by far the largest membership throughout the thirty years, but also that this membership declined <g id="t4">sharp</g> over the period. From 9.5 <g id="t5">thousand</g> in 1970, membership had fallen to two-thirds of that figure by 2000. Similarly, active membership of the Jewish faith fell by approximately a <g id="t6">third</g> during this time.</p>
  <p align="left">Other faiths, however, <g id="t7">rose</g> their membership during the three decades. The most <g id="t8">dramatical</g> rise was in the number of active Muslims. Membership in 2000, <g id="t9">who</g> rose <g id="t10">by</g> around two-thirds of a million, was five times as <g id="t11">higher</g> as it had been in 1970. The number of active Buddhists also rose fivefold during this period. Sikhs and other faiths quadrupled their active membership, while the number of active Hindus <g id="t12">halved</g>.</p>
  <p align="left">The pie chart shows the active membership of all faiths as <g id="t13">an amount</g> of the adult population of Britain. Only just <g id="t14">under</g> 1 in 10 said that they attended services on a weekly basis. Nearly half said they practically never attended religious services.</p>
  <p align="left">However, despite the low numbers of active membership, only a tenth of those questioned reported that they had no religion. This suggests that although the <g id="t15">minority</g> of adults in Britain do not attend services, they do still hold some kind of religious belief.</p>
