  <h1><p>IELTS Writing Task 2</p></h1>
  <p>Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic.</p>
  
  <p><b>Many judges prefer to sentence young offenders to do community service, such as working in an old people's home, collecting litter, or painting a local school, rather than send them to prison. This form of punishment has a number of benefits but also some drawbacks.</b></p>
  
  <p><b>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</b></p>
  
  <p>You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.</p>
