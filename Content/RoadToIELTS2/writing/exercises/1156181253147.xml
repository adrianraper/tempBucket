    <li id="1"><input id="q1"/> &#xA0;It is clear from these figures that western European destinations are still very popular with tourists; four out of the top ten are western European countries. France, Spain and the United States are the top three destinations. France had by far the most tourists that year, with 73 million visitors. This was followed by Spain, with almost 52 million, and the USA, with almost 50 million. Other non-European countries in the top ten were China, Canada, Mexico, the Russian Federation and Poland.</li>
    <p class="linespace"></p>
	<li id="2"><input id="q2"/> &#xA0;The most remarkable growth of all was seen in the Russian Federation, with a 17 per cent increase in tourism from one year to the next. Spain followed with an increase of almost 10 per cent. China's tourist numbers also rose significantly, but some countries such as Poland and Mexico had a noticeable drop in tourism over the year.</li>
    <p class="linespace"></p>
	<li id="3"><input id="q3"/> &#xA0;Perhaps surprisingly to some, air travel seems to be the safest way to get around, with a rate of only 0.4 fatalities for every billion passenger kilometres travelled in the UK. The next safest means of transport is bus or coach. Among the most dangerous ways of getting around are walking and cycling. The fatality rate for pedestrians is 62 per billion kilometres. Not surprisingly, however, the motorcycle is the most dangerous means of transport, with an average of 104 fatalities per billion kilometres.</li>
	<p class="linespace"></p>
    <li id="4"><input id="q4"/> &#xA0;For cars the average number of fatalities on British roads halved between 1981 and 1991. The figure for vans was very similar. Walking and cycling also became safer over the same period, although the fall in fatalities was less dramatic. Motorcycling was the only means of transport which actually became more dangerous during that decade.</li>
    <p class="linespace"></p>
	<li id="5"><input id="q5"/> &#xA0;It is clear from the figures that, overall, people who live in the countryside travel more miles than city dwellers. This is particularly true with regard to journeys by car. However, if we consider other means of getting around, such as walking, there is in fact very little difference. The number of miles travelled annually by urban and rural residents by these means is more or less the same.</li>
    <p class="linespace"></p>
	<li id="6"><input id="q6"/> &#xA0;Overall, the number of journeys made per year is almost the same in rural areas as it is in urban areas. However, there are marked differences in the means of transport used for those trips. Not surprisingly, perhaps, rural dwellers use their cars more often than urban dwellers. Similarly, those who live in the city make more trips using forms of transport other than their cars.</li>
