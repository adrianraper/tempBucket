    <li id="q1">In most countries the majority of crimes are committed by young men under the age of 30. Why is this so, and what can be done to reduce the problem?<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a1">advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="a2">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a3">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q2">Many judges prefer to sentence young offenders to do community service, such as working in an old people's home, collecting litter, or painting a local school, rather than send them to prison. This form of punishment has a number of benefits but also some drawbacks.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a4">advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="a5">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a6">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q3">Prison serves no useful purpose for young first-time offenders. No young person committing a crime for the first time should receive a prison sentence.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a7">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a8">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a9">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q4">Prison should be a last resort for young first-time offenders. It is preferable to sentence young people who have broken the law to do community service, such as working in an old people's home, collecting litter, or painting a local school.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a10">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a11">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a12">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q5">As populations in developed countries age, those countries increasingly need workers from abroad. Developed countries should reduce restrictions on the immigration of workers and their families from poorer countries.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a13">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a14">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a15">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q6">Every year thousands of workers from poor countries enter richer, more developed countries illegally to live and work, and this gives rise to a variety of social problems in those countries. What can be done to deal with this situation?<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a16">advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="a17">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a18">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q7">The birth rate in many developed countries is falling and, as a result, these countries increasingly need workers from poorer countries to help their economies grow. This movement of workers brings many benefits but also creates social problems for the countries involved.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a19">advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="a20">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a21">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q8">We are all citizens of the world. People should be allowed to move freely, and to live and work in the country of their choice without restrictions.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a22">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a23">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a24">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q9">Just as the state provides schools for the education of older children, it should provide facilities such as cr&#xE8;ches and nurseries for babies and very young children so that working women can continue in their jobs when they become mothers.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a25">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a26">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a27">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q10">In many workplaces women still do not enjoy the same opportunities as their male counterparts. Why is this so, and what can be done to make opportunities for women more equal?<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a28">advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="a29">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a30">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q11">Many of the problems in modern society arise because children do not receive enough attention from their mothers when they are very young. Mothers of young children should be obliged to stay at home and look after them rather than go out to work.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a31">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a32">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a33">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q12">Some people argue that many of the problems in modern society arise from mothers going out to work and therefore spending less time with their children. Although the increasing number of working women causes some social problems, it also brings a number of benefits to society.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a34">advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="a35">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a36">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q13">More and more people throughout the world are now living to a very old age and it is unreasonable to expect their families to look after them. The state should take responsibility for caring for old people when they are no longer capable of looking after themselves.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a37">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a38">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a39">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q14">In many countries people are expected by law to work until they reach the age of 65, and then retire. Many people would prefer to retire younger, while some would like to continue working longer, for example until they are 70. Laws should be flexible in allowing people to choose when they want to retire.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a40">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a41">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a42">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q15">On reaching retirement age, many people feel that they are no longer useful members of society. Why do they feel like this, and what can be done to make them feel they still have a contribution to make to society?<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a43">advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="a44">for and against</a></li><li><a id="a45">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
    <br/>
    <li id="q16">Advances in medicine and health care mean that increasing numbers of people are living to a very old age. This creates a number of social problems, but at the same time has some positive effects on society.<list class="answerList"><li><a id="a46">advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="a47">giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="a48">problem and solutions</a></li></list><br/></li>
