  <li>The birth rate in many developed countries is falling and, as a result, these countries increasingly need workers from poorer countries to help their economies grow. This movement of workers brings many benefits but also creates social problems for the countries involved.

  <li>Just as the state provides schools for the education of older children, it should provide facilities such as cr&#xE8;ches and nurseries for babies and very young children so that working women can continue in their jobs when they become mothers.

  <li>Many of the problems in modern society arise because children do not receive enough attention from their mothers when they are very young. Mothers of young children should be obliged to stay at home and look after them rather than go out to work.

  <li>Some people argue that many of the problems in modern society arise from mothers going out to work and therefore spending less time with their children. Although the increasing number of working women causes some social problems, it also brings a number of benefits to society.

  <li>More and more people throughout the world are now living to a very old age and it is unreasonable to expect their families to look after them. The state should take responsibility for caring for old people when they are no longer capable of looking after themselves.

  <li>In many countries people are expected by law to work until they reach the age of 65, and then retire. Many people would prefer to retire younger, while some would like to continue working longer, for example until they are 70. Laws should be flexible in allowing people to choose when they want to retire.
