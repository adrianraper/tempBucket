  <p>Dear Carl,</p>
  <p>Thanks for your letter. I think going to a language school is a great way to improve your English. As you know, I've done quite a few English courses so you've come to the right person for advice! There are definitely a few points you should consider before you enroll on a course.</p>

  <p><g id="t1">The first thing I'd do if I were you is</g>&#xA0;ask about the methodology. Some schools have you sitting in rows doing lots of written exercises.&#xA0;<g id="t2">I don't think you should</g>&#xA0;enrol at this type of school because the lessons can be very boring and you don't get much oral practice.&#xA0;<g id="t3">I'd advise you to</g>&#xA0;choose a school that encourages lots of group work and speaking practice.&#xA0;<g id="t4">You should</g>&#xA0;check the school's brochures and talk to the staff and students if you can.</p>
  
  <p>Also,&#xA0;<g id="t5">you ought to</g>&#xA0;find out what the maximum class size is.&#xA0;<g id="t6">If I were you, I wouldn't</g>&#xA0;enroll in a class with more than 20 students because you won't get enough attention from the teacher. What's more, big classes tend to be mixed ability so you may find the pace is too slow or too fast for you. I think between 10 and 15 students is a good number.</p>
  
  <p>And another thing&#xA0;<g id="t7">you'd better</g>&#xA0;think about is the intensity of the course. You can do an intensive 100-hour course in a month but&#xA0;<g id="t8">I wouldn't advise you to</g>&#xA0;do this. If you've got the time,&#xA0;<g id="t9">I think you should</g>&#xA0;study over a longer period to allow yourself time to assimilate everything.</p>
  
  <p>Anyway, I hope this is useful. If you need any more advice, just drop me a line.</p>
  
  <p>All the best,</p>
  
  <p>Ali</p>
