  <p align="left">Firstly, work-related stress stems largely from ever-increasing workloads. Companies today demand that employees cope with heavier workloads while working to tighter and tighter deadlines. This not only puts workers under great pressure but also means that they work far longer hours than they used to. <g id="t1">For</g> the sake of employees' well-being, legislation limiting the number of hours worked should be strictly enforced. Furthermore, systems agreed on by both management and employees ought to be implemented <g id="t2">to</g> avoid excessive workloads and unrealistic deadlines.</p>
  <p align="left">Secondly, a major source of stress in today's workplace is the rapid pace of technological change. <g id="t3">In order to</g> keep ahead in business, companies need to invest in new technology. This often means, however, that employees are constantly having to get used to using new equipment, software or techniques, and this can be a frustrating and stressful process. It is essential, therefore, that whenever such innovations are introduced, employees should be given adequate training and support <g id="t4">so that</g> the changeover to new technologies is relatively stress-free. Also, perhaps managers should take a more judicious approach to the introduction of new technology <g id="t5">so as to</g> avoid unnecessary change, and not just make change <g id="t6">for</g> change's sake.</p>
  <p align="left">Finally, today's lack of job security and the consequent worry about the future contribute significantly to stress in the workplace. Few employers these days offer long-term contracts. As a result, workplaces are becoming increasingly competitive as employees try to reach targets set by their managers <g id="t7">in order to</g> secure their future with the company. Clearly, the only way to address this is for employers to show more commitment towards their employees. Legislation ought to be brought into force <g id="t8">with the aim of</g> protecting workers' rights and ensuring a greater level of job security for employees.</p>
