    Nowadays, whenever a catastrophic event such as a war or an earthquake takes place, there is usually a television or video camera on hand&#xA0; <b>which</b> &#xA0;will film and broadcast images of it around the world almost instantly, no matter how disturbing they might be. It is often suggested that these are not the kind of pictures we should have to see in our homes, but there are some who think there are very good reasons why&#xA0; <b>such</b> &#xA0;images should be included in television news reports.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    Firstly, it is sometimes claimed that when disturbing images of war or some other disastrous event are broadcast, people become motivated to do something to remedy the situation or to help the victims. Unless the public see these images, it is argued,&#xA0;<b> they</b> &#xA0;are unlikely to act. On the other hand, it is also said that if people see too many disturbing or violent scenes on the news, they grow accustomed to&#xA0; <b>them </b> &#xA0;and no longer react as if these events were something unusual.  As a result, they may begin to think that what they are seeing is normal or even acceptable.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    Secondly, there is the issue of whether or not children should be exposed to such images. It is sometimes argued that television news reports should show the world as&#xA0; <b> it </b> &#xA0;really is and that it is best for children to be aware of this reality. The counter-argument to&#xA0; <b> this</b>, however, is that violent images on television can be particularly disturbing for children, and that some of&#xA0; <b>them</b> &#xA0;may be severely traumatised by seeing such things.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    Finally, it is often pointed out that if viewers find images upsetting,&#xA0; <b>they</b> &#xA0;can simply switch off the television or change channel. However, viewers are not always forewarned that a report may include distressing pictures. Besides&#xA0; <b>this</b>, most people would probably find flicking from one channel to another during a news programme rather frustrating.
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    On balance, I think the argument that this kind of television reporting can sometimes help bring an end to a tragic situation is a very powerful&#xA0; <b>one</b>. However, broadcasters must take care to protect children, and others who do not wish to be upset, by showing potentially disturbing images only after a certain time in the evening.
