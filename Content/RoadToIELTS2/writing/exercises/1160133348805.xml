  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
  <p>My family and I are planning a holiday to Scotland in August and I am writing for more information about your hotel.</p>
  <p>I know the hotel is close to the sea, but&#xA0; <g id="t1">I would be grateful if you could</g> &#xA0;give me details of its exact location.&#xA0; <g id="t2">Can you tell me</g> &#xA0;how close it is to the nearest beach? Also, how far is it from the town centre? Would we need to hire a car during our stay?</p>
  <p><g id="t3">I would also like to know</g> &#xA0;what facilities the hotel has. Is there an indoor swimming pool, for example, and do you provide a babysitting service?&#xA0; <g id="t4">Could you also tell me</g> &#xA0;whether the rooms have an Internet connection?</p>
  <p>Lastly, my elderly mother will be coming with us and she has problems walking up stairs.&#xA0; <g id="t5">I was wondering</g> &#xA0;if the hotel has a lift. If not,&#xA0; <g id="t6">please let me know</g> &#xA0;whether it would be possible to book a single room on the ground floor for her. Also, will we have to pay a supplement for the single room?</p>
  <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <p>Jenny Walsh</p>
