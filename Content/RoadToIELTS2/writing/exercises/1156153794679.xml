  <p align="left">The chart &#xA0;<g id="t1">is showing</g>&#xA0; the &#xA0;<g id="t2">numbers</g>&#xA0; of boys and girls in Australia who take part in five different leisure activities. Overall we can say that boys' participation in these activities &#xA0;<g id="t3">was</g>&#xA0; greater than that of girls.</p>
  <p align="left">It is immediately clear that the most popular leisure time activity among this age group is watching television. Almost all children in Australia &#xA0;<g id="t4">are spending</g>&#xA0; their free time in this way and this is true for both boys and girls. However, in three of the four remaining activities, boys' participation &#xA0;<g id="t5">was</g>&#xA0; significantly greater than that of girls.</p>
  <p align="left">The next most popular activity is playing computer games. Four out of five boys enjoy these games, compared to almost &#xA0;<g id="t6">three in four</g>&#xA0; girls. Bike riding follows computer games in terms of popularity. Just under three-quarters of boys say they like cycling compared to approximately &#xA0;<g id="t7">a fifth</g>&#xA0; of all girls. The only activity which &#xA0;<g id="t8">has become</g>&#xA0; more popular with girls than with boys is art and craft. Just over 50 per cent of girls enjoy this pastime compared to only about &#xA0;<g id="t9">a quarter</g>&#xA0; of boys.</p>
  <p align="left">The figures &#xA0;<g id="t10">are seeming</g>&#xA0; to suggest that the stereotypical image of boys being more active and girls more artistic or creative still holds some truth in Australian society.</p>
