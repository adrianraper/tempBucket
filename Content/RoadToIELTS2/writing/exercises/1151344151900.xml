  <p>Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic.</p>

    <b>Rapid progress in the fields of genetics and gene therapy are likely to have profound effects on people's lives in the foreseeable future. By altering people's genetic make-up, it may be possible for doctors to cure hereditary diseases, and for parents to choose important characteristics for their children such as their sex or level of intelligence. Such a development would be a major breakthrough for humanity and would solve many present-day problems.</b>
