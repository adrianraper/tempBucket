  <p align="left">Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
  <p align="left">I am writing to thank you for your<g id="t1">fabulous</g> series 'A Hundred Years of Radio'.</p>
  <p align="left">My whole family thoroughly enjoyed each of the <g id="t2">excellent</g> broadcasts in the series, so much so that on Thursday evenings we would all rush home expressly to listen to them. My youngest son, who is only twelve, is not usually interested in radio programmes but even he enjoyed them. In fact, he found them <g id="t3">invaluable</g> as he has been doing a project on the history of radio at school.</p>
  <p align="left">I must say we particularly enjoyed the <g id="t4">fascinating</g> narration by George Pickering and his <g id="t5">insightful</g> comments, as well as all the <g id="t6">wonderful</g> recordings from the early days of radio. The <g id="t7">original</g> and <g id="t8">creative</g> style of the series was also extremely <g id="t9">impressive</g>.</p>
  <p align="left">We would very much like to know whether you are planning to air more <g id="t10">stimulating</g> programmes of this kind in the future. If so, we would appreciate it if you could inform us in advance so that we do not miss them.</p>
  <p align="left">Thank you once again.</p>
  <p align="left">Yours faithfully,</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs M. Alty</p>
