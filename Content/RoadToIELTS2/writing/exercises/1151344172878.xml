  <p align="left">Coins minted by the British Royal Mint go through a lengthy production process before they are ready for distribution to high street banks. The first stage takes place at the foundry, where non-ferrous metals <g id="t1">are drawn</g> from furnaces. The metal <g id="t2">is subsequently flattened</g> to the required thickness in the rolling mill. This sheet metal <g id="t3">is then fed</g> into the blanking press, which produces up to 10,000 blank coins per minute. Blanks only gain value as coins when they <g id="t4">are stamped</g> with a design. Prior to this, however, they must <g id="t5">be softened and cleaned</g> in the annealing and pickling plant. Once this <g id="t6">is completed</g>, the blanks go to the coining press, where the two faces of the coins <g id="t7">are stamped</g>. At the same time, the milling around the edge of the coins <g id="t8">is also stamped</g>. Next, a sample of the coins goes through a rigorous quality inspection known as the Trial of the Pyx. At this stage, trained goldsmiths check that the size, weight and composition of the coins meet the legal requirements. The coins are finally ready to go into circulation.</p>
  <p align="left">The flow chart shows how theatre companies advertise themselves and their productions.</p>
 
 <p align="left">
    <font color="#000000">The company might want to advertise even if tickets for a specific event are not yet available. This can <g id="t9">be done</g> through what <g id="t10">is known</g> as a &#x2018;teaser&#x2019; campaign, which stimulates public interest before subsequent campaigns reveal exactly what the event is. Alternatively, an &#x2018;awareness&#x2019; campaign can <g id="t11">be used</g> to inform the public about the work of the company in general. If, on the other hand, tickets are available, then organisers will need to run a campaign designed specifically to increase sales.</font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Whatever the campaign, there are three basic steps that need <g id="t12">to be followed</g>. First of all, the schedule must <g id="t13">be planned</g>. Next, the actual advertisements need <g id="t14">to be designed</g>. Finally, the campaign starts running.</p>
  <p align="left">If the advertisements are part of a sales campaign, the company needs to know how effective they are. While the campaign is running, ticket sales <g id="t15">are monitored</g>. If sales figures are disappointing, then the company can either redesign the advertisements or drop the campaign altogether. On the other hand, if sales figures are good, it is probably worth continuing the campaign.</p>

    <font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">We tend to use passive voice when describing processes because we want to focus attention on the action. You should use passive voice appropriately in reports that describe flow chart, but don't overdo it! You do not have to make every verb passive and remember that some verbs, for example, intransitive verbs such as 'sleep', do not have a passive form.</font>
