    <g id="t4">D In 1997 the percentage who were informed by newspapers was just over twice the percentage for radio.</g>

<section id="fb1">
  <p align="left">A. This summarises the main changes shown in the 'television line'.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb2">
  <p align="left">B. This is one of the most dramatic changes shown in the chart.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb3">
  <p align="left">C. This is more or less true for most of the period shown in the chart. There is nothing special about 1992 in this respect.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb4">
  <p align="left">D. This is neither the biggest difference between radio and newspapers that existed during the period, nor the smallest.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb5">
  <p align="left">E. The report should compare figures for the three media at the same point in time. Comparing radio in one year with newspapers in another doesn't tell us very much about their relative popularity.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb6">
  <p align="left">F. The report should compare figures for the three media at the same point in time. Comparing radio in one year with newspapers in another doesn't tell us very much about their relative popularity.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb7">
  <p align="left">G. The overall downward trend is much more important than these occasional slight rises.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb8">
  <p align="left">H. This is immediately noticeable when you first look at the chart, and is important to note in the report.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb9">
  <p align="left">I. Such a small rise at only one point in time is not a very significant fact to report.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb10">
  <p align="left">J. This shows a significant change in the way people inform themselves about the world.</p>
</section>

<section id="fb11">
  <p align="left">K. This is clearly one of the main findings of the survey and should be mentioned in the report.</p>
</section>

<section id="rt2001">
  <p align="left">In your report you are expected to describe all the important information shown in the chart or graph and to comment on the most significant trends. You are not expected, and you will not have time, to describe every detail. This means that before you write, you must decide which information should be included and which information does not need to be mentioned.</p>
