  <p align="left">In many countries mobile phones have become a normal part of daily life for almost everyone, from professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, to young children. Some people, however, <select id="q1"><option>would like</option><option>like</option><option>liked</option></select> to see ownership restricted because of the possible risks these phones pose to our health and the negative impact they are already having on society. But should such restrictions be imposed?</p>
  <p align="left">There are some persuasive arguments in favour of restricting ownership. Firstly, radio wave emissions from mobile phones <select id="q2"><option>are known</option><option>known</option><option>have known</option></select> to affect brain activity and some scientists are worried about the effects this may have on the health of children who use such phones. <select id="q3"><option>It is claimed</option><option>I claim</option><option>It claims</option></select> that fewer people would <select id="q4"><option>be exposed</option><option>exposed</option><option>expose</option></select> to these risks if restrictions <select id="q5"><option>were introduced</option><option>have been intorduced</option><option>are introduced</option></select>. Furthermore, it is <select id="q6"><option>generally</option><option>sometimes</option><option>often</option></select> agreed that such measures would <select id="q7"><option>reduce</option><option>reduced</option><option>be reduced</option></select> the number of traffic accidents caused by people talking on their mobile phones. There is also the social impact to consider. It is now common for a concert, a theatrical performance or even a quiet meal in a restaurant to be disrupted by an inconsiderate mobile phone user. <select id="q8"><option>It is sometimes said</option><option>We sometimes say</option><option>They sometimes say</option></select> that none of this would be the case if the government <select id="q9"><option>restricted</option><option>will restrict</option><option>restricts</option></select> ownership to professional use only.</p>
  <p align="left">On the other hand, there are strong arguments against such measures. Firstly, it is <select id="q10"><option>widely</option><option>hightly</option><option>broadly</option></select> believed that mobile phones are indispensable in the case of accidents, or when other difficult situations arise, and that everyone should have the right to the protection they offer. Secondly, it is argued that if phone companies <select id="q11"><option>did</option><option>will do</option><option>do</option></select> more to raise public awareness of the risks posed by radio wave emissions, people would only make short calls from their phones and these risks would then be reduced. Finally, it is <select id="q12"><option>often</option><option>always</option><option>never</option></select> pointed out that there will always be a minority of inconsiderate people and that restrictions on ownership would unfairly <select id="q13"><option>penalise</option><option>have penalised</option><option>penalised</option></select> the majority of considerate users.</p>
  <p align="left">To sum up, <select id="q14"><option>I believe</option><option>it is believed</option><option>I am believed</option></select> that some restrictions on ownership to protect young people's health <select id="q15"><option>would probably be</option><option>were probably</option><option>would not be</option></select> a good thing. However, adults should have the right to use mobile phones if they wish, for both personal and professional purposes.</p>
