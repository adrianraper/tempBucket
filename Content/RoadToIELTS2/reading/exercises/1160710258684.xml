<h1><p>Keeping your teeth healthy</p></h1>

<p>Clean teeth and healthy gums feel good and look great. They help you to have the confidence to get really close to people. Good mouth care from birth sets the pattern for healthy teeth for life. To maintain healthy teeth it's important to choose the right drinks and foods, to brush your teeth twice every day and to visit the dentist on a regular basis throughout your life.</p>

<p><b>Common dental problems</b>&#xA0;Tooth root decay can occur when the gum recedes as a result of gum disease and is an increasing problem as more people aged over 65 keep their own teeth. Reducing between-meals sugar intake and using a fluoride toothpaste are particularly important if you have receding gums.</p>

<p><b>Abscesses</b>&#xA0;can cause pain, swelling and fever. Contact your dentist without delay if you have an abscess.</p>

<p>A&#xA0;<b>dry mouth</b>&#xA0;causes discomfort, makes the wearing of dentures almost impossible and can increase the risk of infections. A dry mouth may be a side effect of drug treatment or can be a symptom of a disease affecting the salivary glands. You can relieve a dry mouth by sucking sugar-free sweets, sugar-free chewing gum or by using water sprays and saliva substitutes.</p>

<p>Many people have&#xA0;<b>sensitive teeth</b>. If your gums recede slightly to expose part of the root, your teeth may hurt when you have hot or cold drinks or food. Toothpaste for sensitive teeth can often help; use your fingertips to rub a little toothpaste where teeth and gums meet. If the problem continues for more than six weeks ask the dentist for help.</p>

<p><b>Thrush</b>&#xA0;is a fungal infection that may show itself as white spots on the tongue, a red area beneath a denture or red patches at the corners of the mouth. It may be caused by ill-fitting dentures, poor dental hygiene or lowered resistance to infection. It should always be treated. See your dentist or doctor for advice.</p>

<p><b>Ulcers</b>&#xA0;have a variety of causes. Your pharmacist, doctor or dentist may recommend lozenges or mouth rinses to relieve the pain they cause. If ill-fitting dentures or broken teeth are causing pain and discomfort, your dentist will be able to help. Any ulcer that has not healed after two weeks should be checked by a doctor or dentist.</p>

<p><b>Bleeding of the gums</b>&#xA0;while brushing is caused by a build-up of plaque or germs where your teeth and gums meet. The plaque inflames the gums and makes them bleed. Keep brushing the problem areas gently. Disclosing tablets will show where you have left plaque or germs on your teeth after brushing. Your dentist or hygienist will explain how to use them. The bleeding should soon stop, but if it doesn't, ask your dentist for help.</p>
