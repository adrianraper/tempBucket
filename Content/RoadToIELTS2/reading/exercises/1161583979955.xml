<h1><p>BBC Experience</p></h1>
<div id="reading">
<p class="hangingIndent"><b>A</b>&#xA0;Situated beneath Broadcasting House in London, the BBC Experience is one long advertisement for the Beeb or a new interactive exhibition celebrating 75 years of broadcasting, depending on your frame of mind.</p>

<p class="hangingIndent"><b>B</b>&#xA0;Groups of up to 30 people are guided through a series of rooms, each one offering a different experience. First come a few static exhibits describing the early years of radio, followed by a multiscreen video diary of a typical day at Broadcasting House. Then the group gets the chance to record a short radio play, before moving into two rooms to watch a slide show relating the key events of the 20th century and the role of the BBC in reporting them. Finally, visitors are let loose in the interactive room where they can play with various gadgets and video games.</p>

<p class="hangingIndent"><b>C</b>&#xA0;The first two rooms are as exciting as watching a test-card transmission. To make things worse, visitors must spend 15 minutes in each room as all the dividing doors are operated by timers. However, the radio play can be great fun, particularly if you abandon your inhibitions. The slide show is artfully executed but hardly the cutting edge of technology.</p>

<p class="hangingIndent"><b>D</b>&#xA0;You can stay as long as you like in the interactive room. Some of the gadgets are enjoyable &#x2013; you can direct a scene from a soap opera, remix a music track, present the weather forecast, appear on a radio programme, commentate on a variety of sports events and operate the puppets on children's television.</p>

<p class="hangingIndent"><b>E</b>&#xA0;Groups leave every 15 minutes and you can buy tickets on the door or pre-book by phone. If you turn up at the busiest times (between 11am and 2pm), you may not get on the next tour.</p>

<p class="hangingIndent"><b>F</b>&#xA0;The exhibition is open 9.30am-5.30pm daily. The last group leaves at 5.30pm. Snacks and meals are available in the ground-floor cafe. Take the tube to Oxford Circus or Great Portland Street.</p>
