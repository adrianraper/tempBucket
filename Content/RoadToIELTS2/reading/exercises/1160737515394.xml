  <h1><p>Bathing Beauty</p></h1>
    
  <p>How many different countries are there on the British mainland south of Hadrian's Wall? You could argue that there were five: England, Wales, London, Cornwall and Bath.
  </p>
  
  <p>Of these, in many ways the most utterly foreign is Bath. The historic architecture, the flawless sense of style, the sheer depth of the place &#x2013; the harder you look, the better it becomes &#x2013; is more recognisably in the tradition of an Italian city than an English one; indeed, the only two other entire cities to have been designated World Heritage Sites are Florence and Rome. They, not Edinburgh or Norwich or York, are Bath's true peers.
  </p>
  
  <p>It is the splendour of John Wood's architecture that gives Bath its cachet and secures its place not just as a great historical site &#x2013; the Roman baths alone would be enough to ensure that &#x2013; but as one of the world's truly great living cities.
  </p>
  
  <h7>Making the most of it</h7>
  
  <p>A car is not an asset in Bath. A park-and-ride scheme operates for the benefit of day visitors, but a longer stay will mean bothersome games of hunt-the-space. Road signs are discreet, and Bathonians share the Italian intolerance of anyone who stops to read them. It is a compact city. The station receives plenty of trains. Take the hint.
  </p>
  
  <p>The best way to enjoy Bath is simply to wander around it. There are guidebooks, there are open-top bus tours, and there are enough pay-to-enter tourist attractions to fill your diary for a week. To approach it as a museum, however, is rather to miss the point. The real pleasures of Bath are exactly the same as they were in the 18th century. Walk, take tea, then walk some more.
  </p>
  
  <p>The great architectural set pieces are well known. The two John Woods, father and son, between them created Queen Square, the Grand Circus, the Royal Crescent and the Assembly Rooms &#x2013; among the best examples of their kind in Europe. Robert Adam provided the elegant shop-lined Pulteney Bridge. Thomas Baldwin added the classical, colonnaded Bath Street (a favourite pitch for street entertainers) leading to the abbey and Pump Room. Walking between and around these, doing nothing more organised or premeditated than following your nose, will deliver the distilled essence of Bath far more efficiently than traipsing around any kind of mapped-out tourist route.
  </p>
  
  <p>Sooner or later you will find yourself at the Roman baths. This is a monument of world importance, around which you are directed by a hand-held audio guide. The commentary is not intellectually challenging but, if you don't mind spending the afternoon with your hand clamped to your ear, it is enough to sketch in a broad-brush outline of what you are looking at.
  </p>
  
  <p>What else to do? If "trails" are your thing, then you can be led around the Georgian city in the footsteps of Bath's favourite author. Jane Austen found much of her material here, and used Bath as a backdrop for both Persuasion and Northanger Abbey.
  </p>
  
  <p>For a more direct glimpse into the world of bonneted ladies &#x2013; or, at least into their wardrobes &#x2013; head for the Museum of Costume, in the basement of the Assembly Rooms (not the same day as the Roman baths, however, unless you are addicted to audio tours).
  </p>
  
  <p>Other museums include the American Museum (American period furnishings and folk art), the Bath Abbey Heritage Vaults (displaying the history of Christianity in the city), the Bath Industrial Heritage Centre, a book museum, a postal museum, the museum of the Royal Photographic Society, and No 1 Royal Crescent &#x2013; a perfectly restored John Wood interior.
