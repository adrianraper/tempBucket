	<p align="left">In your report you will have to describe a number of different trends or patterns that are shown in the table or chart. It is important that you let the reader know when you have finished dealing with one aspect of the figures and are about to deal with another aspect. There are certain 'signpost' expressions, which good writers use in order to achieve this, for example, 'concerning' or 'regarding'. When you use these expressions, make sure you follow them with appropriate sentence structure.</p>
