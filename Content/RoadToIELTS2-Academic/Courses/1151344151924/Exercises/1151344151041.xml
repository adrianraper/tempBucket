	<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>Multiple Choice (x1)</b></font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">(Students choose 1 answer for 1 mark)</font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">This exercise consists of a series of questions about the text, with a number of possible answers to choose from. In this case, there's only one correct answer per question.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Sometimes the questions focus on the meaning of the whole text. For example, you may be asked to choose a suitable title. In this case, it's important to keep in mind the overall gist of what you've read. Some of the answers may be true statements about a specific detail, but they don't summarise the whole text.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Other multiple choice questions focus on a specific part of the text. If you have already skimmed through the passage, you will be able to find the relevant section quickly. For each question, read only the paragraph that you think contains the answer.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">With any multiple choice exercise, don't go searching through the text until you've compared the alternatives carefully and made sure you are clear about how each one is different. Read the whole question and all the distractors. Some of the distractors will contain words that are mentioned in the text, but don't immediately assume that this is the correct answer. You ought to consider the meaning of the whole sentence, not just single words. </p>

	<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"><b>Summary Completion</b></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">(Using words from the passage/using words from a box)</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">This is usually the last of the exercises for a given text, so by the time you reach this exercise you should already have a good idea of what the text is about and how it is organised. You are given a short, gapped summary of the main points of the whole text or the main points of an important part of the text. You will be asked to fill the gaps in the summary with words or phrases taken either from the text or from a word box given with the exercise.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">The first thing to do is read the summary once through, without worrying about the gaps. Decide if the summary refers to only a particular section of the text. If so, go directly to that section and read it through again carefully. If, on the other hand, the summary deals with the main points of the whole passage, make a note of how many separate points the summary mentions. Go back to the text, skim through it until you have found these same points and underline or number the relevant parts of the text. Once you have done this, you will find it easier to move back and forth, comparing the summary with the original text. Now you are ready to fill the gaps.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">As with all gap-filling exercises, check the instructions carefully. There will be a limit to the number of words you can use in a gap. Usually this is up to three words, but check this is the case.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">If you have to use words or phrases from the text, make sure that they fit grammatically. The words on either side of the gap will help you understand whether a noun or a verb or a whole phrase is needed. Remember, though, that this is a reading test and not a grammar test. If a single word is needed to fill the gap, you can be sure that it will be a word that carries meaning on its own. In other words, articles, auxiliary verbs and pronouns are not gapped on their own. The missing words are key words in the text.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">If you have to use words from a word box rather than the text, remember that the box contains more words and phrases than you need. Again, the grammar of each sentence in the summary will help you choose the correct word. Don't be tempted to use a word from the box just because you saw the same word in the passage. Some of the words in the box will be taken from the text, but sometimes the words you need to use are synonyms of important words from the passage. Cross off the words as you use them and write them in the gaps on the question paper. Before you finally copy your answers onto the answer sheet, read through the summary and check that what you've written makes sense and agrees with the information in the passage.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"><b>Table Completion</b></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">(Gaps are NOT part of sentences)</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">This is an exercise which checks how quickly and accurately you can find specific pieces of information in the text. The table you have to complete will summarise certain parts of the passage. In some cases all the information will be found in the same section of the text. Sometimes information for each column or row may come from different sections. If you have already skimmed over the text, you should know which part will give you your answer, so you can go directly to the relevant section.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">Before you search for your answers, take time to understand how the table is organised. Look at column and row headings, so that you know what kind of information is required. The information in the text is presented in the same order as the numbered gaps in the table and knowing this should help you find your answers.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">As with all exercise types, don't forget to read the instructions carefully. Usually, your answer should be no more than three words or a number.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"><b>True/False/Not Given</b></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">(Factual information)</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">Sometimes you're given a list of statements and asked if they are true or false. It's important to remember that you should answer true or false according to the information in the text, not according to what you happen to know about the subject.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">First read through the statements, underlining key words. These need very careful reading to avoid common traps. Read each one a couple of times so that you understand the logic. Often, a statement which appears to say the same as the text in fact states the opposite, simply through a change of word order. Other common traps are with words which express quantity or degree, such as 'the most', 'all', 'completely' and 'everyone'. For example, the text might say 'most people agreed to the plan', while the statement says 'everyone agreed to the plan'. In this case the statement is false. Any kind of comparison, 'more likely', 'less expensive', or 'as old as' for example, also needs very careful reading.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">Remember that probably at least one of the statements will fall into the 'Not Given' category. Many students have some difficulty understanding the difference between 'Not Given' and 'False'. A 'False' statement actually contradicts what is said in the text, whereas a 'Not Given' statement states information beyond that given in the text, and we cannot know if it is true or not. The difference will become clearer to you if you try writing a few of your own 'False' and 'Not Given' statements for a text you've read.</font></p>
