Underneath each one is a ballast tank, which carries up to 1600 litres of water. The carriages run along 53 metres of parallel steel track and are linked by steel cables. These go around a large drum at the top of the slope.</font></p><p align="left">When one carriage is at the top of the hill, the other is at the bottom. The ballast tank underneath the top carriage is filled with water from a reservoir <font color="#0000ff">so as to make it slightly heavier than the lower carriage. <font color="#0000ff">Due to</font> this imbalance, the top one begins to roll down the hill, pulling the other one up. A computer control system weighs each carriage <font color="#0000ff">in order to</font> gauge exactly how much water is needed to make them move. Speed is controlled by means of a braking system built into the drum at the top. This consists of a hydraulic pump, which slows the drum down if it is turning too fast, <font color="#0000ff">causing</font> the carriages to reduce speed. Each time this happens, the system compresses gas in special cylinders.<font color="#0000ff"> As a result</font>, some of the energy of braking is stored. This can later be used to pump a proportion of the water back up to the reservoir. <font color="#0000ff">Consequently</font>, some energy is recycled.</font></p><p align="left">The water-balanced railway is an excellent example of how renewable energy sources can be used to power a transport system.</p><p align="left"><font size="2"></font></p>
