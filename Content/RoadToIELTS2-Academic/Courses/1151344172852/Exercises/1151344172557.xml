		<b>Matching Headings to Paragraphs or Sections/Choosing from a Bank of Headings</b></p><p align="left"></p>
		<p align="left">This exercise type tests how quickly you can skim through a text in order to understand the main ideas discussed and how they are developed and organised. You'll probably find that this exercise comes before exercises that ask you to find specific information, such as sentence completion or short answers. If this is not the case, it's still a good idea to start with this exercise, because it will help you get an overall picture of what the text is about. You shouldn't spend too long on this exercise; you're supposed to be skimming quickly.</p>
		<p align="left"></p>
		<p align="left">The headings listed in the exercise summarise the main points of each paragraph. And, in fact, the first sentence of each paragraph, sometimes called the topic sentence, does exactly the same. So, the best way to deal with this exercise is to read through the list of headings, underlining key words, and then skim through the text, reading only the first sentence of each paragraph.</p>
		<p align="left"></p>
		<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Now take each heading one by one. Go back again to the topic sentences. Look out for words that mean the same as those given in the headings. When you find a match, make a note on the text and tick the heading off the list. If you're still not sure about which heading matches, read the last sentence of the paragraph, which usually summarises what has been said. Be careful, though. There are usually one or two distractors: headings which include some of the key words, but which actually don't match any of the paragraphs. Don't just rely on vocabulary that seems to match. Read the topic sentences of each paragraph carefully enough to understand the idea which it expresses before deciding on a match.</font></p>

		<b>Sentence Completion</b></font></p><p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">('Free-standing' sentences/sentences in a flow chart)</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">This exercise involves completing sentences which paraphrase or summarise a piece of information in the text. As always, make sure you read the instructions carefully. The words must be taken from the text and you mustn't change them in any way. You will be given a word limit for the gaps, which is usually up to three words, but you ought to check this is the case. The gapped words are not normally contractions, so if you find you need to use a contraction to stay inside the word limit, then your answer is probably wrong.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">The sentences follow the order of the text, so this should give you an idea of where to look to find the answer. If you need a two or three word phrase to fill a gap, then these words will be found close together in the text, in the same sentence. Don't try to 'make' phrases by collecting words from completely different parts of the text.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">Remember that the completed sentence must be grammatically correct. It helps if you look at the words immediately before and after the gap. If these words are prepositions, articles or auxiliary verbs, then you should know what kind of word (noun, verb or participle for example), will follow.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="verdana" size="13" color="#000000">This exercise is intended to check if you have understood the main points of the text, so the words and phrases that are missing are important ones that carry a lot of meaning. Once you've completed a sentence, read it to yourself. Does it summarise a main point or piece of information from the text? If not, then you need to think again about your answer.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><b>Diagram Completion</b></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Occasionally you are asked to use the information given in the text to complete labels on a diagram. This will be a visual summary of a part of the text, with gapped labels that you have to fill.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Spend some time looking carefully at the diagram. It will usually have a title, which should help you recognise which section of the text it refers to. The numbered gaps follow the order in which information is given in the text, so this should help you find the right words.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">As always, read the instructions carefully. Usually you are asked to complete the diagram with words taken from the passage. There will be a word limit for each gap, so make sure you check what it is. As with short answers and sentence completion, the words you need to complete a gap will be found close together in the same sentence.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Read the labels in the diagram and then scan the relevant section of the text for those words, or words that mean the same.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">At least one of the gaps will probably be a number and the phrase before the gap, as well as the drawing, will give you clues as to what kind of number is required, such as speed, height or temperature. Also, look out for units of measurement, such as kilometers, kilogrammes or hours after the gap.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Finally, as with all gap-filling exercises, you should make sure that the words you choose fit grammatically.</p>

	<p align="left"><b>Multiple Selection</b><font color="#0000ff"></font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">(Multiple answers with 1 mark each)</font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">This is similar to the multiple choice exercise but with two main differences. Firstly, there's usually only one question. Secondly, you have to select more than one correct answer from the list of alternatives. You are given one mark for each correct answer you choose. The instructions will tell you exactly how many items from the list you must choose. This exercise usually summarises the main points of the text and so is often the last of the exercises on a given text.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">The first thing to do is to read the list of alternatives carefully and make sure you are clear in your mind about how each item in the list differs from the others. If all the items in the list refer to the same part of the text, you should already know which part of the text has the information. Go straight to the relevant section and read through carefully, ticking off items in the list as you find them.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">If the list of options summarises information from the whole of the text, then it's best to take a slightly different approach, taking each item in the list in turn. Read the first item in the list and underline key words. You may already recognise which part of the text the words refer to. If not, skim through the text searching for the keywords or words which mean the same. When you've found them, read from the beginning of the previous sentence until the end of the following sentence, keeping in mind the meaning of the whole sentences, not just the words. Is this meaning the same as the first item in the list? If yes, choose this item and move on to the next.</p>
