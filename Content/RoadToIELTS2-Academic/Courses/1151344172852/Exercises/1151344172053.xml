	<img class="rightFloat" src="../Media/WB_TV_006.jpg" mode="1" id="1001"  /><p align="left">Dear Jonathon,</p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">Sorry I haven't been in touch for a while but I've been rather busy job hunting! Yes, I'm afraid I lost my fabulous job! I'm sure you remember how I boasted about the wonderful working conditions - the <input id="1" width="100" /> that meant I could work when I wanted to, and the wonderful <input id="2" width="100" /> of promotion! Well, I was made <input id="3" width="100" /> in March. I should have seen it coming really. The economic <input id="4" width="100" /> here led to a dramatic drop in sales, which affected the company's <input id="5" width="100" /> so badly that it almost went <input id="6" width="100" /> at the end of last year. </font></p><p align="left">Then in February things started to look up as another company in the same field stepped in and a <input id="7" width="100" /> took place. When that happened, I thought I might just keep my job, but they decided that they didn't need such a big <input id="8" width="100" />, and one of the first things they did was to <input id="9" width="100" /> the company and <input id="10" width="100" /> a lot of the work to consultants and other companies.</p><p align="left">Anyway, since then I've been to at least twenty interviews but I'm getting nowhere. It's quite depressing actually because I've spent years getting the perfect <input id="11" width="100" /> together and it's looking really good now. I've got over fifteen years' experience in the marketing field, I've been on lots of courses and I've picked up quite a few <input id="12" width="100" /> along the way. I've also got some great <input id="13" width="100" /> from previous employers but it seems that the <input id="14" width="100" /> is just flooded with people like me. </p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">What's more nobody wants to take on new staff in the present economic climate, at least not on full-time contracts. One company asked me if I was interested in <input id="15" width="100" /> - can you imagine that? Half the pay for probably just as much work! I'm seriously considering <input id="16" width="100" /> - I've got my own computer and an Internet connection and I quite fancy the idea of working from home for a change.</font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">I'm afraid I haven't really got any other news for you - and I'd better get back to scouring the papers for job ads!</font></p><p align="left">Take care, Claire.</p><p align="left"><font size="2"></font></p>
