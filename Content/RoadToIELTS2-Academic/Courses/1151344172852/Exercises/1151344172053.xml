Yes, I'm afraid I lost my fabulous job! I'm sure you remember how I boasted about the wonderful working conditions - the <input id="q1" /> that meant I could work when I wanted to, and the wonderful <input id="q2" /> of promotion! Well, I was made <input id="q3" /> in March. I should have seen it coming really. The economic <input id="q4" /> here led to a dramatic drop in sales, which affected the company's <input id="q5" /> so badly that it almost went <input id="q6" /> at the end of last year. </font></p><p align="left">Then in February things started to look up as another company in the same field stepped in and a <input id="q7" /> took place. When that happened, I thought I might just keep my job, but they decided that they didn't need such a big <input id="q8" />, and one of the first things they did was to <input id="q9" /> the company and <input id="q10" /> a lot of the work to consultants and other companies.</p><p align="left">Anyway, since then I've been to at least twenty interviews but I'm getting nowhere. It's quite depressing actually because I've spent years getting the perfect <input id="q11" /> together and it's looking really good now. I've got over fifteen years' experience in the marketing field, I've been on lots of courses and I've picked up quite a few <input id="q12" /> along the way. I've also got some great <input id="q13" /> from previous employers but it seems that the <input id="q14" /> is just flooded with people like me. </p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">What's more nobody wants to take on new staff in the present economic climate, at least not on full-time contracts. One company asked me if I was interested in <input id="q15" /> - can you imagine that? Half the pay for probably just as much work! I'm seriously considering <input id="q16" /> - I've got my own computer and an Internet connection and I quite fancy the idea of working from home for a change.</font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">I'm afraid I haven't really got any other news for you - and I'd better get back to scouring the papers for job ads!</font></p><p align="left">Take care, Claire.</p><p align="left"><font size="2"></font></p>
