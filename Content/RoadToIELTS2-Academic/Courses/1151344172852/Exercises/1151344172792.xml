	<img class="rightFloat" src="../media/WB_TV_005.jpg" mode="1" id="1001"  /><p align="left">Dear Jonathon,</p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">Sorry I haven't been in touch for a while but I've been rather busy job hunting! Yes, I'm afraid I lost my fabulous job! I'm sure you remember how I boasted about the wonderful working conditions - the <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q1" type="droptarget" /></font> that meant I could work when I wanted to, and the wonderful <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q2" type="droptarget" /></font> of promotion! Well, I was made <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q3" type="droptarget" /></font> in March. I should have seen it coming really. The economic <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q4" type="droptarget" /></font> here led to a dramatic drop in sales, which affected the company's <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q5" type="droptarget" /></font> so badly that it almost went <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q6" type="droptarget" /></font> at the end of last year. </font></p><p align="left">Then in February things started to look up as another company in the same field stepped in and a <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q7" type="droptarget" /> took place. When that happened, I thought I might just keep my job, but they decided that they didn't need such a big <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q8" type="droptarget" /></font>, and one of the first things they did was to <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q9" type="droptarget" /></font> the company and <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q10" type="droptarget" /></font> a lot of the work to consultants and other companies.</font></p><p align="left">Anyway, since then I've been to at least twenty interviews but I'm getting nowhere. It's quite depressing actually because I've spent years getting the perfect <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q11" type="droptarget" /> together and it's looking really good now. I've got over fifteen years' experience in the marketing field, I've been on lots of courses and I've picked up quite a few <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q12" type="droptarget" /></font> along the way. I've also got some great <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q13" type="droptarget" /></font> from previous employers but it seems that the <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q14" type="droptarget" /></font> is just flooded with people like me. </font></p><p align="left">What's more nobody wants to take on new staff in the present economic climate, at least not on full-time contracts. One company asked me if I was interested in <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q15" type="droptarget" /> - can you imagine that? Half the pay for probably just as much work! I'm seriously considering <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q16" type="droptarget" /></font> - I've got my own computer and an Internet connection and I quite fancy the idea of working from home for a change.</font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">I'm afraid I haven't really got any other news for you - and I'd better get back to scouring the papers for job ads!</font></p><p align="left">Take care, Claire.</p><p align="left"><font size="2"></font></p>
