	<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>Multiple Choice (x2)</b></font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">(Students choose 1 answer for one mark) </font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">This exercise consists of a series of questions about the text, with a number of possible answers to choose from – in this case, there are 2 correct answers per question.</font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Sometimes the questions focus on the meaning of the whole text, for example, you may be asked to choose a suitable title. In this case it's important to have in mind the overall gist of what you've read. Some of the answers may be true statements about specific detail, but they don't summarise the whole text.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Other multiple choice questions focus on a specific part of the text. If you have already skimmed through the passage, you will be able to find the relevant section quickly. For each question read only the sections that you think contain the answers.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">With any multiple choice question, don't go searching through the text until you've compared all the alternatives carefully and make sure you are clear about how each one is different. Read the whole question and all the distractors. Some of the distractors will contain words that are mentioned in the text – but don't assume it's the correct answer. You need to consider the meaning of the whole sentence, not just single words.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><b>Sentence Completion</b></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">You will be given a number of incomplete sentences which you need to complete with information from the listening text. The sentences may be in a table.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Read the instructions carefully. They will usually state that your answer should be NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS OR A NUMBER. But check this is the case.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Read the sentences.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">If the sentences are part of a table, check whether the questions are horizontal or vertical.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Try to work out what you will be listening to. Any headings or sub-headings given will help you.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Decide what you are listening for.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Try to work out what grammatical form should follow the last word given in the sentence. Make sure you read the stem of the sentence carefully.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Complete the sentences as you listen.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">The information will be given in the same order as the questions although it may be expressed differently. Listen out for words or phrases of similar meaning to those in the sentence stems.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">You may use your own words. Make sure your sentences are grammatically correct.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Remember as you write, the answer could be a number, one word, two words or three words but not four words or more.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">If you think you need more than three words your answer is probably incorrect.</p>

	<p align="left"><b>Matching sentence beginnings to endings</b></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">In many ways these exercise types are similar to multiple choice questions. Exercises typically consist of the first half of a series of statements with a number of possible outcomes or endings to choose from.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Read all the questions and answers carefully and be sure you understand how the different options change the meaning of the complete sentence. From the vocabulary, try and predict what the topic of the listening will be. At this stage you might be able to guess some answers and eliminate some options.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">Be careful – some distractors in the options might be synonyms (words that mean the same thing) with words in the listening, but you shouldn't assume that this is the correct answer. You need to consider the meaning of the whole sentence, not just individual words.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><b>Labelling a Diagram</b></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">You will be given a diagram and asked to label it with labels given in the listening text. Sometimes you may be given a box of words or phrases from which to select the labels.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Read the instructions carefully. They will state how many words you should use if there is not a box of labels provided. You could be asked to write one word only.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Study the diagram.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">You may be able to predict one or two answers or associated vocabulary that you may hear connected to a particular label.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Check whether the labels are numbered in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">The information will be given in the same order as the numbers on the diagram.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Write down or select the labels as you listen.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Use the words you hear, not your own.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Remember to listen carefully when words are spelt out. Write them down even if you don't know where they go.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Use the information given on the diagram to help you if you get lost.</p>
