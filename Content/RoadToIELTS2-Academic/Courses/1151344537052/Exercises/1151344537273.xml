Each line of the <input id="q3" type="droptarget" /> is not only extremely funny but often thought-provoking too. It is brought to life by a very talented <input id="q4" type="droptarget" /> at the Haverstone Underground Theatre. I have rarely seen such an animated audience in the interval after the first <input id="q5" type="droptarget" /> of a play.<p align="left"><b>The Sally Adam Exhibition</b>This is an impressive collection of <input id="q6" type="droptarget" /> of people the artist has known. Through brilliant splashes of colour and bold brushstrokes on very large <input id="q7" type="droptarget" />, Sally Adam depicts the characters of these people. She has also included a <input id="q8" type="droptarget" /> in which she reveals glimpses of her inner psyche. This is an amazing departure from her earlier years as a landscape <input id="q9" type="droptarget" />.</p><p align="left"><b>Africa by Storm</b>What a disappointment this video is! Maybe if it was not <input id="q10" type="droptarget" /> into English but had <input id="q11" type="droptarget" /> instead it would be better. On the positive side, the <input id="q12" type="droptarget" /> has some interesting twists and there are some lovely picture-postcard <input id="q13" type="droptarget" />, especially of the wildlife along the Zambezi River. However, as the film was originally destined for the big <input id="q14" type="droptarget" /> rather than video, these do not have quite the visual impact that was intended.</p><p align="left"><font size="2"></font></p>
