We went to see it at the new theatre last night. It was a really odd production actually. There were about twenty musicians and only one actor and we really weren't impressed with either the show or the theatre.</p><p align="left">We'd booked our seats over the telephone but we didn't get the ones we'd asked for. We'd wanted seats up in the <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q1" type="droptarget" /> but we were in the front <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q2" type="droptarget" /></font> of the stalls, right behind the <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q3" type="droptarget" /></font>, who played far too loudly. Also, I couldn't see half the time because the <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q4" type="droptarget" /></font>'s head kept getting in the way and the <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q5" type="droptarget" /></font> was packed so we couldn't move anywhere else. </font></p><p align="left">It was pretty boring too, watching one actor walking around the <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q6" type="droptarget" /> for nearly two hours, there were no <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q7" type="droptarget" /></font> really either. He just wore a pair of black trousers and polo-neck sweater. He used only one <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q8" type="droptarget" /></font> too - a camera. I was really relieved when the <font color="#0000ff"><input id="q9" type="droptarget" /></font> finally came down and we could go home.</font></p><p align="left">So, anyway, if I were you, I'd definitely give it a miss.</p><p align="left">I'm afraid I have to dash now - will write later if I have time.</p><p align="left">Take care, </p><p align="left">Katie</p><p align="left"><font size="2"></font></p>
