The sale, which took place at a new <input id="q2" />, near the National Museum, has been described as scandalous. The paintings are believed to be <input id="q3" /> by the most famous painters of the time and priceless <input id="q4" />'s items. This is just the latest in a series of similar incidents involving the present government. In April last year a number of thirteenth century weapons were auctioned off. These <input id="q5" /> had been part of a permanent collection at the National Museum. In November there was also a covert sale of <input id="q6" /> consisting of ancient Greek clay dishes and pots. It is now thought that the government may have had a hand in the mysterious disappearance of the life-size <input id="q7" /> outside the National Museum. These stone figures are part of our cultural <input id="q8" />. </p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">What will they sell next? When our museums and galleries have been emptied of every last <input id="q9" />, will the countryâ€™s historic <input id="q10" /> be next to go under the hammer?</font></p><p align="left"><font size="2"></font></p>
