We went to see it at the new theatre last night. It was a really odd production actually. There were about twenty musicians and only one actor and we really weren't impressed with either the show or the theatre.</p><p align="left">We'd booked our seats over the telephone but we didn't get the ones we'd asked for. We'd wanted seats up in the <input id="1" width="100" /> but we were in the front <input id="2" width="100" /> of the stalls, right behind the <input id="3" width="100" />, who played far too loudly. Also, I couldn't see half the time because the <input id="4" width="100" />'s head kept getting in the way and the <input id="5" width="100" /> was packed so we couldn't move anywhere else. </p><p align="left">It was pretty boring too, watching one actor walking around the <input id="6" width="100" /> for nearly two hours, there were no <input id="7" width="100" /> really either. He just wore a pair of black trousers and polo-neck sweater. He used only one <input id="8" width="100" /> too - a camera. I was really relieved when the <input id="9" width="100" /> finally came down and we could go home.</p><p align="left">So, anyway, if I were you, I'd definitely give it a miss.</p><p align="left">I'm afraid I have to dash now - will write later if I have time.</p><p align="left">Take care, </p><p align="left">Katie</p><p align="left"><font size="2"></font></p>
