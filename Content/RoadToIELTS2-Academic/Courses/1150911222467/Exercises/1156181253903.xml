	<p align="left">		<b>Matching headings to paragraphs or sections/Choosing from a bank of headings</b></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">This exercise type tests how quickly you can skim through a text in order to understand the main ideas discussed and how they are developed and organised. You'll probably find that this exercise comes before exercises that ask you to find specific information, such as sentence completion or short answers. If this is not the case, it's still a good idea to start with this exercise, because it will help you get an overall picture of what the text is about. You shouldn't spend too long on this exercise; you're supposed to be skimming quickly.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">The headings listed in the exercise summarise the main points of each paragraph. And, in fact, the first sentence of each paragraph, sometimes called the topic sentence, does exactly the same. So, the best way to deal with this exercise is to read through the list of headings, underlining key words, and then skim through the text, reading only the first sentence of each paragraph.</p><p align="left"></p>	<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Now take each heading one by one. Go back again to the topic sentences. Look out for words that mean the same as those given in the headings. When you find a match, make a note on the text and tick the heading off the list. If you're still not sure about which heading matches, read the last sentence of the paragraph, which usually summarises what has been said. Be careful, though. There are usually one or two distractors: headings which include some of the key words, but which actually don't match any of the paragraphs. Don't just rely on vocabulary that seems to match. Read the topic sentences of each paragraph carefully enough to understand the idea which it expresses before deciding on a match.</font></p>

	<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>Multiple choice (x1)</b></font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000">(Students choose 1 answer for 1 mark)</font></p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">This exercise consists of a series of questions about the text, with a number of possible answers to choose from. In this case, there's only one correct answer per question.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Sometimes the questions focus on the meaning of the whole text. For example, you may be asked to choose a suitable title. In this case, it's important to keep in mind the overall gist of what you've read. Some of the answers may be true statements about a specific detail, but they don't summarise the whole text.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">Other multiple choice questions focus on a specific part of the text. If you have already skimmed through the passage, you will be able to find the relevant section quickly. For each question, read only the paragraph that you think contains the answer.</p><p align="left"></p><p align="left">With any multiple choice exercise, don't go searching through the text until you've compared the alternatives carefully and made sure you are clear about how each one is different. Read the whole question and all the distractors. Some of the distractors will contain words that are mentioned in the text, but don't immediately assume that this is the correct answer. You ought to consider the meaning of the whole sentence, not just single words. </p>
