				NEED TO DISCUSS WITH ADRIAN
				
				There are two possibilities:
				
				1. Use the model to define clickable and togglable properties which change the innerHTML and damages and updates the TextFlow.  This
				   is quite htmly, but is kind of complicated and may be a hassle to work with.
				2. Have a overlaid audio component in Bento, skinnable in a title's CSS.  This will be neater and will give more animation possibilities
				   (e.g. sliding out controls).  However, this means that almost certainly all audio players in a title will have the look the same.  This
				   might well be what Adrian wants anyway, so halt development on this until we have had a chat.
