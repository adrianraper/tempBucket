  <p align="left">The chart shows views held by New Zealanders <g id="t1">who attend cultural events</g> regarding <g id="t2">the quality of these events</g>. It is quite clear from the figures that they tend to <g id="t3">disagree</g> on most cultural issues. There are, however, a few issues on which opinions differ.</p>
  <p align="left">The strongest agreement noticeable is in connection with the importance of cultural activities in school and the benefits culture brings to our lives. Almost three-quarters of <g id="t4">those who agree</g> say they strongly agree that children should be involved in cultural pursuits at school. <g id="t5">On the other hand</g> the vast majority agree that cultural activities enrich our lives and bring us closer together. Almost two-thirds of those who agree on this do so strongly. <g id="t6">Similarly</g>, the population is not <g id="t7">such</g> unanimous on some issues <g id="t8">than</g> it is on others. For example, about half the population do not agree that sport is more important <g id="t9">as</g> culture, while the other half think it is. Just over half of <g id="t10">New Zealanders</g> hold this view strongly. <g id="t11">In contrast</g>, although most New Zealanders believe that they have a sense of their cultural identity, a significant minority, just under <g id="t12">1 in 10</g>, do not feel this way.</p>
  <p align="left">Although they do not agree on all issues, it seems overall that most New Zealanders have fairly positive attitudes towards their nation's cultural life.</p>
