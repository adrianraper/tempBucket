	<p align="left">Questions 1-7 - Multiple choiceThe questions in this exercise need quite detailed, careful reading.&nbsp;Question 1 Many of the options are true of Glen Nisbett, but there's only one reason why he's mentioned in the passage.

You have to read between the lines.&nbsp;Question 6The key word in the question is 'NOT'.

    <b>Leisure in the Fast Lane</b>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Glen Nisbett, a London-based management accountant, is difficult to reach on weekends. He might be off "experiencing a real winter," he says, as he did in Bergen last January, or "catching up with an old friend" in Venice. Or he could be "having a riot" in New York or "just seeing the sun again," which he did on a last-minute break to Alicante in April. "There are so many places I want to see, but I'm restricted in terms of how much time I can take off work," he explains. "So I pack as much as possible into two or three days at a time."</p>
  <p align="left">
    <font color="#000000">Like Nisbett, more and more Europeans are finding that the once-traditional four-week summer vacation is no longer an option. According to the European Travel Monitor, short trips of between one and three days accounted for 27% of all breaks taken in 1999. Six out of 10 trips now last a week or less. And short holidays are more ambitious than ever before.</font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <font color="#000000">Numerous factors are fueling the boom in minibreaks. Demanding jobs and erratic hours mean that longer holidays, which often need to be planned well in advance, may be difficult to arrange. Shorter, more frequent vacations &#x2013; often extended weekends or business trips &#x2013; fit into busy schedules better. Besides, money is plentiful, and so are good deals. Low-cost, no-frills airlines have opened up a growing list of destinations.</font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <font color="#000000">City trips take the biggest slice of the short-break cake. Paris, London and Rome remain the favored stops but among seasoned nomads "there's a feeling of 'Been there, done that'," says Christine Ball, spokeswoman for a leading U.K. tour operator. Hence the growing popularity of what were once "second-string" cities: Lyons and Carcassonne in France, Milan and Bologna in Italy and Bilbao and Seville in Spain. Eastern Europe is also catching on: Estonia's Tallinn, Latvia's Riga and Poland's Krakow are all billing themselves as "the new Prague." And Reykjavik, with its all-night street parties in summer and huge club scene year-round, is benefiting from the boom in young, hip tourists.</font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
    <font color="#000000">Travelers are not just taking more city breaks, they expect to be entertained while they're there. Says Robin Zimmermann, PR Manager at TUI Germany, the country's largest tour group: "People want more out of a city than just sightseeing." Like fabulous food or their favorite music. One of TUI's most popular trips: a gastronomy weekend in Lyons, which culminates in an evening meal at the restaurant of the original celebrity chef, Paul Bocuse. Opera buffs are flocking to Verona now that dozens of tour operators are offering tickets to Aida and La Traviata in its world-famous Arena as part of the tour.</font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Increasingly, European holidaymakers are going farther afield for quick kicks. Lyn Hughes, editor of a magazine for independent travelers, says that a survey revealed that the city most readers wanted covered as a weekend break was Rio de Janeiro. "We're sending a writer down there this summer to see whether it can be done," she says dubiously. But Lucy Nicholson, product manager for upmarket tour operator Cox &amp; Kings, which recently introduced four-night trips to both Rio and Cape Town, says it's "such a fabulous place that you won't even notice the jet lag." Her prediction for the next hot destination? Buenos Aires, a further three hours away. Fritidsresor Group, Scandinavia's largest tour operator, is market-testing long weekends in Toronto and Beijing. "It's only a nine-hour flight," says communications director Lottie Knutson, of Beijing. "If it's somewhere you've always wanted to go, you'll do it. It's a new way of thinking."</p>
