  <p align="left">Questions 1-8 - ClassificationMake sure you're clear about which letters and combinations of letters are used for each category. The text is clearly divided into sections dealing with each artist in turn, so you need to skim through each section looking for key words and phrases or synonyms of key words and phrases used in the questions.</p>
  <p align="left">Notice that the artist Beckmann is also grouped with Rembrandt and Picasso to form two of the categories. Each time you find something that applies to Beckmann, you should look through the sections on Rembrandt or Picasso and decide if it also applies to them. Similarly, when you find something that applies to Rembrandt or Picasso, you should check whether it also applies to Beckmann.</p>
