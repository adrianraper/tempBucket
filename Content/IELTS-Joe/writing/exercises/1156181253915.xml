However, no town council has yet had the courage to completely prohibit private motor vehicles from entering the city centre. There are several reasons why <select id="1" type="dropdown" ><option id="o1">I believe"</option>"<option id="o2">I support"</option>"<option id="o3">I am in favour of"</option>"</select> this should be done.</p><p align="left"><select id="2" type="dropdown" ><option id="o4">The most important reason is"</option>"<option id="o5">I am opposed to"</option>"<option id="o6">A good exampe of this is"</option>"</select> pollution from car exhausts, which damages people's health causing respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis. At the same time, traffic fumes attack the stonework of historic monuments and buildings, while the vibrations from passing vehicles damage their foundations. This, <select id="3" type="dropdown" ><option id="o7">for instance"</option>"<option id="o8">I agree"</option>"<option id="o9">I am against"</option>"</select>, has happened to many old cathedrals in Europe.</p><p align="left"><select id="4" type="dropdown" ><option id="o10">A second reason"</option>"<option id="o11">The most important reason"</option>"<option id="o12">A final reason"</option>"</select> why I am <select id="5" type="dropdown" ><option id="o13">in favour of"</option>"<option id="o14">convinced that"</option>"<option id="o15">of the opinion that"</option>"</select> cars being banned is in order to reduce the noise pollution from traffic, which forces people to keep their windows permanently closed and may cause psychological problems including stress and depression among people living in busy streets.</p><p align="left"><select id="6" type="dropdown" ><option id="o16">A further reason"</option>"<option id="o17">The most important reason"</option>"<option id="o18">The final reason"</option>"</select> is that most cities were not designed for motor traffic. <select id="7" type="dropdown" ><option id="o19">A good example of this is"</option>"<option id="o20">Personally, I feel that"</option>"<option id="o21">I am strongly of the opinion that"</option>"</select> the historic centre of Valencia, which has narrow streets and few facilities for parking. As a result, traffic moves very slowly and there are frequent traffic jams.
