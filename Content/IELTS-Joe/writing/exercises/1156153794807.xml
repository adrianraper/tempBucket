  <p align="left">In the past fifty years, television has become more popular among children than any other form of home entertainment and many children spend several hours a day watching it. <select id="q1"><option>Although</option><option>However</option><option>Despite</option></select> parents and teachers often disapprove of it, few would prevent their children from watching it altogether.</p>
  <p align="left">As a leisure activity, television has several advantages for children. <select id="q2"><option>Firstly</option><option>Furthermore</option><option>Moreover</option></select>, it is an easier and safer way for them to relax than, <select id="q3"><option>for instance</option><option>like</option><option>such as</option></select>, playing in the street or in a park.  <select id="q4"><option>Secondly</option><option>Consequently</option><option>For example</option></select>, television can be highly educational because children can learn about subjects, <select id="q5"><option>like</option><option>in addition</option><option>even though</option></select> music or sport, that they might not read about in books. <select id="q6"><option>Moreover</option><option>In contrast</option><option>Including</option></select>, they acquire a wider vocabulary and improve their general knowledge. <select id="q7"><option>Lastly</option><option>To sum up</option><option>In conclusion</option></select>, television fosters children's interest in subjects and gives them interests in common. <select id="q8"><option>In consequence</option><option>For example</option><option>Despite this</option></select>, they are better-informed about the world than children were in the past and they form attitudes and opinions about things outside their direct experience.</p>
  <p align="left"><select id="q9"><option>However</option><option>Although</option><option>Whereas</option></select>, any invention as pervasive as television is bound to have some harmful effects. Nowadays perhaps, children in general are not as sociable as previous generations of children, who used to spend more time playing with friends. <select id="q10"><option>As a result</option><option>However</option><option>Furthermore</option></select>, some children may feel lonelier and more isolated. <select id="q11"><option>In addition</option><option>In contrast</option><option>In consequence</option></select>, they may be less imaginative than children in the past because they do not have to invent their own games and because they spend less time reading books. <select id="q12"><option>Finally</option><option>However</option><option>As a result</option></select>, since they spend so much time in front of the television, they may have fewer hobbies, and, <select id="q13"><option>therefore</option><option>for instance</option><option>in conclusion</option></select>, their range of leisure activities may be more limited than previous generations.</p>
  <p align="left"><select id="q14"><option>To sum up</option><option>Finally</option><option>Therefore</option></select>, it is clear that television has had both positive and negative effects on the way children spend their leisure time. I believe that parents should monitor both how much time their children spend watching television and the type of programmes they watch, and encourage them to watch those which are either entertaining or educational. <select id="q15"><option>However</option><option>Although</option><option>Lastly</option></select>, children should also be encouraged to find time for other activities, <select id="q16"><option>such as</option><option>moreover</option><option>as a result</option></select> playing with friends or pursuing hobbies.</p>

  <p align="left">When you have finished this exercise, compare the composition with the linking words and phrases with the composition without them, as you saw it in Exercise 2. Notice how the linking words and phrases make the structure of the composition and the writer's arguments much easier to follow.</p>
