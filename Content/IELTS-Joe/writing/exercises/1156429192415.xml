  <p align="left">In Unit 1 and Unit 5 we looked at static charts - charts that do not show change over time. We saw that simple tenses were most appropriate for describing such charts. In this unit and in Unit 2 we have been dealing with charts and graphs that show changes over time. These are sometimes referred to as 'dynamic' charts and graphs. To describe this kind of chart you need to use a greater variety of verb tenses including past simple, past perfect and occasionally present perfect or future perfect.</p>
