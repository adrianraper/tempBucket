This form of punishment has a number of benefits but also some drawbacks.<ol class="answerList"><li><a id="q4" >advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="q5" >giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="q6" >problem and solutions</a></li></ol><br/></li><br/><li id="3">Prison serves no useful purpose for young first-time offenders.

Developed countries should reduce restrictions on the immigration of workers and their families from poorer countries.<ol class="answerList"><li><a id="q13" >for and against</a></li><li><a id="q14" >giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="q15" >problem and solutions</a></li></ol><br/></li><br/><li id="6">Every year thousands of workers from poor countries enter richer, more developed countries illegally to live and work, and this gives rise to a variety of social problems in those countries.

This movement of workers brings many benefits but also creates social problems for the countries involved.<ol class="answerList"><li><a id="q19" >advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="q20" >giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="q21" >problem and solutions</a></li></ol><br/></li><br/><li id="8">We are all citizens of the world.

Mothers of young children should be obliged to stay at home and look after them rather than go out to work.<ol class="answerList"><li><a id="q31" >for and against</a></li><li><a id="q32" >giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="q33" >problem and solutions</a></li></ol><br/></li><br/><li id="12">Some people argue that many of the problems in modern society arise from mothers going out to work and therefore spending less time with their children. Although the increasing number of working women causes some social problems, it also brings a number of benefits to society.<ol class="answerList"><li><a id="q34" >advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="q35" >giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="q36" >problem and solutions</a></li></ol><br/></li><br/><li id="13">More and more people throughout the world are now living to a very old age and it is unreasonable to expect their families to look after them.

Many people would prefer to retire younger, while some would like to continue working longer, for example until they are 70. Laws should be flexible in allowing people to choose when they want to retire.<ol class="answerList"><li><a id="q40" >for and against</a></li><li><a id="q41" >giving an opinion (i.e. one side of the argument only)</a></li><li><a id="q42" >problem and solutions</a></li></ol><br/></li><br/><li id="15">On reaching retirement age, many people feel that they are no longer useful members of society. Why do they feel like this, and what can be done to make them feel they still have a contribution to make to society?<ol class="answerList"><li><a id="q43" >advantages and disadvantages</a></li><li><a id="q44" >for and against</a></li><li><a id="q45" >problem and solutions</a></li></ol><br/></li><br/><li id="16">Advances in medicine and health care mean that increasing numbers of people are living to a very old age.
