	<p align="left"><font color="#000000">When describing an object we often use relative clauses to give information about its function, construction and so on. These may be defining relative clauses, for example:</font></p>&nbsp;A ballast tank is a tank which holds water for weight.&nbsp;The relative clause gives essential information about the object, so it is a defining relative clause.&nbsp;Or they may be non-defining relative clauses, for example:&nbsp;The carriages, which can carry up to 20 passengers, go up and down a steep slope.&nbsp;The relative clause gives additional information about the object, so it is a non-defining relative clause. Only non-defining relative clauses need to be enclosed in commas.
