When you talk about yourself, give an example to illustrate your point. The Examiner knows nothing about you. Your words will give him or her a clearer picture of you and your interests. Parts 1 and 2 consist of questions asked by the examiner. Answer them fully, logically and clearly, if you can. If you can't, communicate fully, logically and clearly.</p><p align="left">Now listen to Alexandra explaining her answer to the question "What do you do? Do you work or study?" How would you answer this question?</p>
